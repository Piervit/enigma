Enigma is a Java application that allows you to browse decompiled Java sources from a Jar file. 
The source browser highlights the obfuscated class/field/method/argument names and allows easy renaming. 
All the mappings are saved internally to an efficient data structure which can be saved/loaded. 
Enigma also includes many code browsing features such as declaration lookup, call graph searches, and inheritance hierarchy browsing.
Enigma even allows you to convert mappings between different versions of the Jar file using an intelligent matching system.
